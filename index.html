<h1>Janmesh.net - Joint Access Mesh Networking</h1>
<h1 style="text-align:center;font-size:120%;">If renting a <em>house</em> for <span style="font-size:130%;">one month</span> was costing the same price as <br/><span style="font-size:130%;margin-left:25%">buying it for your whole life</span></h1>
<h4>And if renting implied that the house owner would then own any good you got on this earth<br/><span style="margin-left:67%;">...and make you work without getting paid</span></h4>
<h1 style="font-size:140%;margin-right:39%;"><span style="font-size:130%;">What</span> would <br/><strong><em>you</em></strong><br/>choose? </h1>

<h3>Janmesh is a project of mesh networking over cjdns/olsrd that extends automatically over the network medium available, whatever it is</h3>
Being an ethernet cable to your neightbour's garage, a wifi link (that now can reach one thousand meter of distance or more), a wimax link to connect distant cities, or even a tunnel crypted through the ordinary internet, the medium does not matter. For the user, there is only one unique, unified network
<h3>Just plug in a Janmesh device and you're done</h3>
Just plug into your house's network one Janmesh-enabled device running Janmesh.net's Jasede software and access all the services and features it offers from any of your home's web-enabled device (software currently being in the earliest possible development stage)
<h2>Rethink the whole internet paradigm</h2>
Run your own brick of web service, whatever it can be, straight from your home. Never abandon your freedom and rights again. Choose what you share, with whom, privately and securely.
